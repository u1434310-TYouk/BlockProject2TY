A Simple Hash Function class that takes in an input from the console and spits out a modified hash code.

This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information.

As this is an extremely basic (and very poor) implementation of a Hash Function, there should be little worry of malicious use. However, this could be used to trick the most gullible and un-techy kind of person, so be aware.
